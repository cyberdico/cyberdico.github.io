## What's Pi-hole?

Discover Pi-hole, a free DNS service that protects your devices from unwanted contents.

With the evolution of new threats, you'll no doubt be trying to protect yourself, perhaps with a SaaS tool. However, you'll also be asking yourself another legitimate question: where does my browsing data go?

Publishers will assure you that every measure is being taken to protect your precious data. And yet, we know that businesses are also targets of cyberattacks. Small and medium-sized businesses, institutions and organizations with limited financial resources are also highly exposed, and don't have the budget to deal with threats. Pi-hole is an excellent solution for actively blocking evolving lists of malicious domains.

It works simply: a list of domains, graphical monitoring of KPIs and safer browsing for users.

## Where to download?

As with any solution, the best choice is to visit the publisher's official website.

Here you'll find documentation and the latest source code.
